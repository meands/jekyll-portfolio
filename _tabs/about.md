*meands is pronounced /ˈmiːændz/*

I'm a developer with a focus on building intuitive, clean applications. I have worked extensively with the JavaScript ecosystem. I have dabbled in functional programming, using libraries like [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) and I'm also learning [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).

Currently, I'm an engineer at JP Morgan Chase where I work on an internal data platform.

Outside of work, I mostly make things for fun, check out my [projects](/projects) page to see what I've been working on.

On the [archives](/archives) page you will find some thoughts I have consolidated enough to write about.
